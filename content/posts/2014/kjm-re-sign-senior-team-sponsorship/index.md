[![KJM re-sign Senior Team sponsorship](images/6400591_orig-225x300.jpg)](http://wherwellcc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/6400591_orig.jpg)We are delighted to announce that KJM have agreed to continue as the sponsor of our senior team. This has proved productive so far in attracting players to the club as it shows our commitment to improving not only our playing standard but the infrastructure needed to support the club as it moves forward.

The new agreement secures the team for the next 3 years and will enable us to start to evolve our strategic goals of providing the best possible facilities for both match play and practice.
