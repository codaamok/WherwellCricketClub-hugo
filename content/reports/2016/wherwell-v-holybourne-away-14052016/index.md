Renewed partnership KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Holybourne I. Cpt Robbie Skeates lost the toss and Wherwell were to bowl.

After a good start from Holybourne's openers, the breakthrough was made by Mark Pettman. Holybourne raced on to 65-2 looking to score high but tremendous field work and bowling restricted them to 148 all out. Stuart Taylor bowled 29 for 1 off 10 and backed up by Ollie Emslie 29 for 2 off 10. Wherwell chairman Nathan Young took 5 wickets as finished with 5 for 50 off 9.3. Holybourne were 148 all out after 36 overs.

After some tea openers Jordan Trebert and R Skeates saw off the opening spell and reached 50 before both were gone in quick succession to LBW decisions for 15 each. This brought S Taylor and Alex Gladwyn to the crease and the pair began to rotate the strike and looked to hit the bad balls to the boundary. However, wickets quickly tumbled to 110-7 and the game was right in the balance. Luke Trebert and O Emslie began to pull Wherwell through with sensible batting. L Trebert and O Emslie finished on 11no and 14no gave Wherwell a three wicket win.

KJM sponsored Wherwell I & IIâ€™s have had an excellent start to the season for wins all around so far this season.
