When you're weary, Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all
I'm on your side, Oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Troubled waters at camp Wherwell after yesterday's result, but the bridge is that weâ€™ve been here before. In 2019 we suffered an early defeat at the hands of Chawton and went on to win the league.. history has a habit of repeating itself.

It was the best of times, conditions were close to perfect, it was the worst of times as there was no sign of a red kite nor an eurasian spoonbill - a bad omen for sure. Chawton won the toss, chose to bat and straight out of the blocks set their game plan into motion. Taylor (37) was the first to fall but with 50 on the board and in quick time. Chawton kept the tempo up. Emslie (3-39) was the pick of the bowlers but even he went at close to 5rpo. Chawton wickets fell - Young (4-55) - but the run rate rarely faltered. At 156-6 and with Hamer (65) just gone the innings was in danger of spluttering but T.Charlton (42) and Bachelor (36) punished anything loose and the score swelled to 256-9 off the 40. Wherwell certainly had their chances but failed to capitalise when Chawton were at 6 down.

Chawton opening bowlers failed to make a breakthrough in the first 10 overs  but their tight lines and sharp fielding stopped Wherwell openers from expressing themselves, pushing the RRR up and forcing errors from both. Gladwyn (51) formed the backbone of the chase and whilst there were some cameos from the middle order the run rate required kept climbing and the wickets kept tumbling. Wherwell failed to find any meaningful partners essential for a big run chase and from 142-4 ended up well short 173ao. Will they regret not batting the full 40 overs for the extra two batting points available?

Chawton knew their game plan and executed it well, Wherwell fell short in all three departments. The 83 run defeat doesn't quite feel like a true reflection of the difference between the teams but on the day Chawton deserved the win.
