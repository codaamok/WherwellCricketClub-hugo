I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm, I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb<br/>
I am a world's forgotten boy, The one who searches and destroys<br/>
Honey, gotta help me please, Somebody gotta save my soul, Baby, detonate for me, aw!<br/>
Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology, Ain't got time to make no apology<br/>

The weather looked questionable. The pitch looked decent. The ground looked in good nick if a little short one side. Wherwell won the toss and chose to bat first.. and made a decent start of it for once making it to the 10th over before the first wicket. Cooke (21) plundered three boundaries off the first over as Farley strived to find swing. And it was swing that did the damage with first change Burton. M (3-26) reducing Wherwell from 35-0 to a wobbly 74-6, Ramsay (2-31) chipping in with a couple of key wickets. One strength in the Wherwell team is depth and two late selections combined nicely to firstly soak up the pressure and then ask some questions of the Farley attack. It was a tidy combo off picking the gaps and dispatching the loose balls to the short boundary. However, all good things come to an end and in a case of age before beauty, Fell (21) was run out by partner Foord (46). The vital partnership added 56 and once broken Farley quickly wrapped up the innings, Waters (2-25). The feeling in the camp was 148ao was below par and knew a good start was needed to give us a chance..

Downhill, downwind, a new ball, and a good enough delivery to remove many batsmen, Cutts (2-18) got Wherwell off to bang sending the bails flying in his first over. And thenâ€¦ the party started. It began with a slightly looser, fuller delivery which the batsman crunched straight to short cover, Fell who backed up his smart mouth with a smarter catch. With the targeting systems now fully locked on it was time to search and destroy, hooping one back in to clean bowl the leftie at 3. Then came the triple wicket maiden that ripped the Farley middle order out. A classic nick off, followed by a lovely LBW, and then another half volley crashed straight to Fell leaving the batsman stunned at the crease. Cutts struck in the following over and Farley were suddenly 21-7, the wheels well and truly off. But the man of the hour was not done yet, there was blood in the water and Jon Vokes (7-8) was in amongst it picking up two more wickets before his 8 overs were up. There was just enough time for Burton S (17) to have a little fun before Young (1-16) wrapped up an emphatic win.

The Wherwell batting department is still yet to truly fire on all cylinders but like the many headed hydra there is still plenty of bite for their opponents to worry about. And if there are any kids out there wanting to know how to bowl away swing.. Jon Vokes gonna show you how
