The Wherwell wrecking ball is picking up momentum with a comprehensive victory over Ropley this week. Despite the size of the victory there are still some areas for improvement and that means we can only get better!

Wherwell won the toss and chose to bat on a pitch that looked a little bowler friendly after the rain we have had. Ropley came out fighting picking up edges and putting Wherwell batting line up under pressure and didn’t allow any partnerships to bloom. Louis Sanderson (3-31) was the pick of the Ropley bowlers picking up three key wickets. All the batsmen struggled to find some rhythm and when the battling Skeates (49) miscued a ‘high’ full toss Wherwell found themselves 85-4. The middle order all chipped in with starts, with one man making it look a lot easier than the rest. The palindromic Harry Trebert (33) blazed a few boundaries and helped boost the score to an eventual 179 all out. Disappointing to be bowled out again..

Wherwell started with a bang, Vokes (2-7 – off 8 overs!) picking up an early wicket and never relented with the pressure. Emslie (2-20) picked up the other opener before turning to spin. And then the wheels really came off the Ropley reply. The Ropley batsmen all struggled to keep Young (6-16) out as ripped through the middle and lower order and he waddled away with 6 wickets! Ropley collapsed to 66 all out.

The 22 point win puts Wherwell up to 4th and if the batting line up can fire then who knows what we can achieve.
