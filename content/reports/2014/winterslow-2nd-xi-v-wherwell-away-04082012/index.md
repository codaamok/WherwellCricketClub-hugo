KJM sponsored Wherwell 2 XI visited Winterslow on an blustery saturday with a reduced side due to holidays and a extremem mixture of Youth and Senior players. Having lost the toss Wherwell were asked to field as the home side looked to cash in on the inexperience and shortage of numbers, however they didn't account for the 13 year old Brendon Tasker playing his first ever senior game. He was asked to take the first over and picked up a wicket almost instantly thanks to the safe hands of Mick Ling. Some lusty blows with the wind kept the home side at around 5 an over but wickets fell reguarly as both Rory Griffin (7-1-27-1) and Harry Trebert (7-1-30-3) were rewarded for putting the ball in the right places. It was the vetran "spin" of Mick Ling that had greatest success with (7-3-17-4) and a second wicket for Tasker giving him figures of 7-1-37-2 meant the home side were all out for 120 from 28 overs with only S.Little (33) showing any batting confidence.

Wherwell lost wickets typically early and the reply briefly looked to have a chance with Ling (29) and Ian Whyton (8) adding 40 for the 3rd wicket but once parted the remaining batsmen with the exception of a brick 11 from Steve Bonsor failed to get the ball off the square and Wherwell succumbed for 82, all be it for 8, but under the circumstances it was a tremendous effort to have been in the game for as long as they were.
