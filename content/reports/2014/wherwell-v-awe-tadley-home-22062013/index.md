KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted AWE Tadley on a damp strip.  Losing the toss Wherwell were asked to bat. Stuart Taylor was dropped in the third over and this proved costly as he went on to punish the visitors scoring 76, unfortunately only Elton Adamo offered real support with a well crafted 32 as the home side labored to 167 all out. In reply Craig Beckingham was given the opportunity to open the bowling and his tight lines forced a early run out. Taylor, 4-40, bowled with typical aggression but the match changer was Ollie Emslie who pulled off a superb  over the head catch.  This gave WCC a boost as Matt Guilfoyle Emslie Harry Trebbert and Nathan Young all rotated the bowling and picked up the remaining wickets leaving Tadley 15 short on 152 all out
