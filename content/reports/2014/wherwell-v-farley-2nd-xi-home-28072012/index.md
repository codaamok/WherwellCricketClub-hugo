On the rare occasion this season of a sunny Saturday KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained Farley at a dry but soft playing Fields ground. Having lost the toss Wherwell were asked to bowl, with a young side Dan Pawley and Harry Trebert were entrusted the new ball and both bowled with good control but it was the introduction of Mick Ling that brought the first wicket with a well taken catch by Rory Griffin at fine leg, Griffin bowled unchanged through 10 overs and was unrewarded despite bowling a consistent line and finishing with only 27 runs from his 10. It was this tight bowling that ultimately assisted the wickets for Ling who finished with 2 for 39. Ed John was the only other successful bowler as Farley used wickets in hand to accelerate he took 3 for 36 but the visitors managed to close on 181 for 5.

Wherwells reply made a slow start with some unpredictable bowling a good ball got rid of Ling and a second quick wicket brought Ed John to the crease. After the skipper went for 13 Griffin (17) joined in with the bat and in partnership with John (40) they took the score towards 100. The pair were separated in quick succession and the young tail was mopped up by M Wood with a fine 4 for 31 to see the closing score of 129 all out.
