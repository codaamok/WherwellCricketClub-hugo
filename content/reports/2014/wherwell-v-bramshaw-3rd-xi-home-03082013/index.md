KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained a strong Bramshaw side, after losing the toss the visitors decided to have a bat knowing Wherwell had just ten, but started with just nine due to the late arrival of a player. So with just nine Wherwell knew it was going to tough to stem the runs. Bramshaw's top order began to find the boundaries with ease in particular T.Vane 101 and C.Plumbury 65 really took a liking to the bowling, however Adam Cook 5-27 of 7 overs ensured Wherwell had a chance, but after a huge 256 all out Bramshaw went to tea knowing that the total was above anything Wherwell had scored all season.

After some tea with regular openers Mick Ling away and Nigel Horne called up to the first team, they knew it would be an extremely tough chase, so openers Charlie Ingrem and Adam Cook gave Wherwell a solid start but after losing both in a matter of overs the wickets began fall at all to often intervals. Russell Ingrem 55 not out showed the way and in a team total of just 100, scored over half of the teams runs, no one provided him with support in order to make a decent attempt at the total, as Wherwell fell to a big defeat. With no game this weekend Wherwell will look ahead to next week when then travel to Centurions looking for a win.
