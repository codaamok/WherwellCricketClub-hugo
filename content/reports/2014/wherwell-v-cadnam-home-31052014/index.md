Wherwell 2nd XI hosted Cadnam, for the first time in a fortnight the pitch was deemed to be playable. Mick Ling batted first opening with Jordan Trebert. the pair got off to the perfect start with Jordan in T20 mode, he raced to 50 runs with Ling matching him, they put on 112 before Jordan lost his wicket, his elder brother Luke batting at 3 provided a foil for the classic style of Ling as they took the score to 130 for 1 before Trebert fell for 18. Ling went on to 63 and the team closed the innings on 172 for 5.

This looked to be a competitive score but with a restricted bowling attack the home side were unable to put pressure on the batters, Brendon Tasker held a caught and bowled and Rob Weeks took a fine catch off the bowling of Robbie Gladwyn but the visitors batters took the game away from wherwell with a 166 run partnership to see the win secured by 8 wickets inside 30 overs.
