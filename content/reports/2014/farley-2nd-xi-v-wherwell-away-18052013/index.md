KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Farley as the fixture list made a home & away double for the 2 clubs. Winning the toss on a flat looking strip the visitors chose to field first. With a strong youth contingent in the side Wherwell looked to contain the home team who, knowing the short boundaries square of the wicket, were keen to chase width. The home batters tried hard to get out but Wherwell were not willing to accept the opportunities. 1st change bowler Rob Weeks struck in his first over getting the ball to move back off a length and keep low, but the visitors kept missing their chances and the home teams remaining opener passed 50 and was looking good for a century when Wherwells Under 15 skipper, Nick Baughen produced an in-swinger that would have cleaned up many batsmen and had the desired effect in this case. A magnificent catch by Jordan Trebert and a direct hit run out from Charles Ingrem briefly suggested a return of fielding standards but some hard hitting and wayward bowling saw the home side to a formidable 247 for 4.

Wherwell got off to a indifferent start losing wickets at regular intervals, at 23 for 4 captain Mick Ling was joined at the crease by Ingrem. The 2 settled some nerves and began to build a partnership by exploiting the short boundaries and taking advantage of anything wayward from the bowlers. As Ingrem settled in he started to bully the bowling and quickly got into his stride bringing up his 50 with a clubbing 4, the 100 partnership was soon to follow and the home side started to look unsettled. The breakthrough came for the home side when ling on 47 was adjudged Leg before but Ingrem wasn't finished and in tandem with Paul Whyton pushed the score past 200 and brought up his personal milestone of 100 with a trademark 6. The win never looked possible but the visitors gave it a good try but losing Whyton and Ingrem in successive overs left the result a formality as Wherwell held on for maximum batting points and a huge amount of pride in a hard fought defeat by 40 runs.
