With thunder-storms on the horizon KJM sponsored Wherwell  did all they could to get a game on with players attending the ground before most had breakfast. Winterslow won the toss and decided to bowl on the previously covered pitch, this proved to be a crucial win of the toss as the ball nipped everywhere. Beckingham 29 and Taylor 41 the only batsman to show any true fight and dig in. Wherwells batsman have often been their own downfall and today was no different. Wherwell limped to a very disappointing 141 all out from 32 overs, a score the home team believed to be about 80 runs short.

Winterslow knew chasing this total would still tough against Wherwells bowling but each batsman dug in and valued his wicket. 141 from 45 overs would require no rash shots the batsman just took the loose balls for runs and slowly edged towards the finishing line. Some tight bowling from Matt Guilfoyle 9.3 over 1wicket 18 runs and Oliver Emslie (10-4-24-4) dragged Wherwell back into the game and ensured that the game went the distance but some big hits towards the took Winterslow over the line with 8 balls to spare.
