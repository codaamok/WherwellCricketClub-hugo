KJM sponsored travelled to Hursley with a weakened team but full of energy and knowing they should just enjoy the day regardless of result.

After losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very green strip. After losing a few early wickets, Alex Gladwyn and Matt Guilfoyle tried to rebuild the innings with some smart running. Wherwell started to rebuild until a rush of blood was the downfall of Guilfoyle as he played all around a straight ball. Thankfully the tail wagged again and took Wherwell to a well below par 114.

Knowing they were about 80 short Wherwell went about the bowling trying to restrict runs and make it difficult for the batsman. Some good fielding had IBM working hard for runs but they remained patient and guided themselves to the win after 29 overs.

A big thank you to IBM Hursley as they made us feel welcome and provided us with the best teas of the season by far.
