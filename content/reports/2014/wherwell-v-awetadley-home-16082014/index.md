Wherwell won the toss, pitch was green, weather was English. Skipper decided to bowl first on their own strip.

A rare occasion for Wherwell 1st XI playing with just 10 men occured against AWE Tadley. However the hard work was contributed with great team spirit as always regardless of the situation, where Matt Guilfoyle bowled 24 runs off 10 overs for 3 wickets,  Craig Beckingham making it difficult for AWE Tadley with just 15 runs off 7 overs, and finally Ed Marsh with 28 runs off 6 overs for 3 wickets. Despite the steady bowling efforts and tough fielding work required from Wherwell, AWE Tadley's top four batsmen proved their resilience and posted 175 for 9 after 45 overs.

Despite Wherwell going out to bat with just 10 men against a just above par total of 175, ambitions were high in Wherwell's ability with the likes of Stuart Taylor embarking on a steady and much needed 45, but this was after a rapid loss of wickets from Wherwell's top four batsmen which made Wherwell's objective much harder. Nathan Young followed Taylor's footsteps by contributing a solid 20, however the rest of the line-up were insufficient enough to provide what was required for would have been Wherwell's 6th win of the season.
