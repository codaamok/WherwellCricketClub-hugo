KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to sparsholt wondering how much of a game would get played as the grey clouds threatened to halt play again. Losing the toss they were asked to bat on a very hard green wicket. Starting with intent Jez Wickman and Ed John built a steady opening partnership scoring all round the wicket. Ed John (13) started to look in form before squaring himself up in front of all 3 stumps for a easy LBW decision. Beckingham played sensibly scoring square of the wicket to nudge his way to 22 before also playing across the line for a plumb LBW. Wickham and Gladwyn tried to get the run rate up and this was the doing for Wickham 75 as he was bowled middle stump. Wherwell had a collapse as they pushed for a big total. Wherwell ended 220 all out.

In reply Sparsholt knew 220 was going to be tough only Foster 53 offered any resistance as he stroked a clever 53 before chipping to mid on. Wherwell bowled tight lines on what was a good batting wicket Sparsholt batted for points and protected wickets as well as they could, they ended on 162-9 from 45 overs . Pick of the bowlers N.Young 3-26 from 9 overs, Guilfoyle  2-15 from 6, Taylor 2-22 from 10 and H Trebert 1-15 from 8.
