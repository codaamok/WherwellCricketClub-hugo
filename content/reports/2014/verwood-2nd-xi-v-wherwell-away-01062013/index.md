Wherwell seconds travelled to Verwood when a trip to the beach might have been more appropriate. With only 10 players able to travel there was relief when the toss was won and Wherwell elected to bat on a beautiful looking strip. Early wickets came as no surprise but in the midst of a below par batting performance there were some good knocks from Cray Sams, Harry Trebert, Stephen Bonser and Nigel Horne, all making double figures but managing to find a way to get out. Wherwell were bowled out for 86 in the 27th over.

Despite a wicket in the first over from Trebert Wherwell never really looked able to restrict the home side who raced to a 9 wicket win inside 15 overs.
