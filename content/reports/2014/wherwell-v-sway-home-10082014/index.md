After an unpredictable evening before the game of weather and some hard work from several Wherwell players, the pitch was deemed playable and the call was made to Sway to travel up.

Wherwell's Sunday skipper won the toss and chose to bat on a damp looking pitch. Openers Stuart Taylor and Jordan Trebert opened the batting and were greeted with some very generous bowling, of which Taylor made the most of it, by reaching his 50 just after 3 overs. This great start from Wherwell made Sway make some bowling changes, to stop the boundary barrage, which worked perfectly as runs quickly dried up and wickets started to tumble. The bowling team stuck at it with rigorous perseverance by pulling Wherwell down to 185 all out, with Taylor finishing on 107no, supported by Alex Gladwyn 25 and Cray Sams 22.

After some fantastic teas, Wherwell went out to field in the wind, with Robbie Gladwyn and Russell Ingram opening the bowling - both causing Sway batsmen problems early on, especially R. Gladwyn with his medium pace swing getting himself 2 well deserved wickets. This good start enabled the skipper to rotate his bowlers, and prevent Sway from generating any momentum as wickets fell regularly. Sway finished on 86 all out. Wickets were shared between R Gladwyn, R Ingram, C Ingram, L Trebert, Adam Cook and Harry Trebert.

Happy birthday Luke Trebert.
