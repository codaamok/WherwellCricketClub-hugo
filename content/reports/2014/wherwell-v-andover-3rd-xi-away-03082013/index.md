KJM sponsored made the short journey to London Road 2 pitch, to find a wicket that looked dull and lifeless, After winning the toss Wherwell inserted their hosts and with no real back bone to their innings Andover soon collapsed away as Wherwell took wickets at regular intervals bowled out there hosts for just 117, with the pick of bowlers Mark Pettman 3-25, Stuart Taylor 2-15 and Matt Guilfoyle 2-20.

After some tea openers Craig Beckingham and Stuart Taylor took to the crease. Taylor in a fine run of form began taking the attack apart  and after losing Beckingham for just three. Christian Nicel strolled to the crease and with Taylor the pair really took on the attack and eased Wherwell the total, with Taylor ending up on 76 not out and Nicel 25 not out.
