Wherwell opened with R Skeates and A Gladwyn. Both built a solid partnership enjoying their time in the middle although was throttled by majestic bowling on the glamerous Wherwell pitch.

R Skeates was caught for 60 putting him second in Wherwell's most runs scored so far, just 30 behind current leader Matt Cutts. A Gladwyn was caught for 26 and securing his top spot in the Wherwell's batting averages so far.
