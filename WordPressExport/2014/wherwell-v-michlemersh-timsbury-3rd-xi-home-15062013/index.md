KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted M & T 3rd XI off the back of their first league win. With a number of players unavailable the team had a decidedly "senior" look to it but sometimes old heads are high value and that was proven in amongst the showers under the grey sky. Losing the toss Wherwell were asked to bat and lost the skipper to a 2 man catch early on, Nigel Horne though is starting to look settled and played some gorgeous shots to all corners, a 3rd Wicket 50 run partnership with Mark Pembry (18) looked like being the bedrock of a good total until Pembry left his crease to the spinner, the keeper failed to take the ball but it rebounded off his pads and had the unfortunate batter adjudged stumped. This brought Charlie Ingrem (31) in to bat, with a knee brace on and unable to take quick singles he was on the attack from the start hitting the ball hard and far. Horne fell LBW for 32 but Ingrem carried on in style clearing the rope for an enormous 6. A mini collapse looked to have restricted the home side but some late hitting from the tail by Stephen Bonser (14), TJ Hull (6 no) and Richard Rowles (8) got the score to a competitive 129.

In reply M&T looked strong, with no regular first line bowler but plenty of options Wherwell started to chip away, Mick Ling (7-14-2) found a leading edge that was well taken on the run by Horne but the first bowling change made instant impact. Richard Rowles playing his first league match in 2 years got a ball to straighten for a plumb LBW decision, his next over though was a double wicket maiden, we shall be hearing about this for a while, but the most crucial moment was his catch off Ling to remove the well set opener. Wherwell had the visitors at 40 for 5 and decided to turn the screw, Rowles bowled unchanged for 10-32-3, Pembry picked up 1 wicket caught well by TJ Hull, Mark Saunders also got his first league scalp thanks to sharp keeping from Horne and the innings was wrapped up by a one legged Ingrem for an unexpected 25 run win. This showed once again the value of working and playing as a team.
