KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Amesbury on what can only be described a scorchingly hot day. The wicket for the first time this season was dry, and after winning the toss the visiting skipper Dale Gower had no hesitation in bowling first. Wherwell started slowly trying to build a score. Beckingham (9) and Wickham (16) stayed put seen off the original scare in the first 5 overs. Beckingham soon departed to a good ball bringing the inform Stuart Taylor to the crease. As others lost concentration in the heat Taylor started going through the gears. Only Nathan Young stayed put and dug in for Taylor. Young finally departed for a pain staking 26 but the job was done for the team as Taylor raced towards his second league 100 of the season. Taylor brought up his 100 from 74 balls with a lovely 2 on the leg side only to get outÂ  the next ball. Wherwell ended up 178 all out.

After a few cold drinks and showers Wherwell took to the field knowing a big effort was required. Stuart Taylor was again back in the game as he got the ball to bite from a good length. Some sharp fielding from Beckingham enabled a Taylor to collect his 3rd wicket for 26 runs. Wherwell looked in complete control as they had Amesbury 50-7 but the visiting skipper Dale Gower 51 batted hard and pushed fear into the Wherwell as he dispatched the ball to all parts of the ground. Matt Guilfoyle tried his best to get the other batsman out with figures of 2-40 but it appeared nobody could break this partnership as the skipper rotated his bowling trying to buy a wicket. Thankfully Russell Ingrem 1-18 raised his hand and broke the partnership. Wherwell were suddenly back in the game and Young 4-21 got himself back into the attack to spin his team to victory thanks to a full body dive catch from Gladwyn on the boundary. Amesbury all out for 142
