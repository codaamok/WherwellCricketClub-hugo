With summer finally making a show KJM sponsored Wherwell 1st XI travelled to play Compton & Chandlers Ford, the ground looking perfect set as it is amongst a private development and benefitting from significant recent investments in it's infrastructure that provided excellent protection from the previous days rain. With Captain "Trucker" Taylor winning the toss he typically elected to bat first.

Unfortunately the plan didn't pan out as hoped with both Wherwell openers falling in single figures. But with the home bowlers seemingly struggling to cope with the slope across the pitch runs were on offer and the typically aggressive Alex Gladwyn was happy to take advantage, Batting in tandem with David Langford who hit a solid 34and Craig Beckinham with 16 the score progressed steadily past the 100, as Wherwell looked to accelerate Gladwyn perished on 44. After another quick wicket Matt Guilfoyle entered the arena, in typical flamboyant style he walked down the pitch and drove the bemused bowler for 4, the following overs saw him produce his full range of shots including one vicious sweep that nearly cut the fielder brave enough to stop it in half! Guilfoyle fell in a typical blaze of glory for 22 but thanks to the return of the  "Malteese Falcon", James Spackman, who ran well with Cristian Nicel and deposited the final ball of the day over long on Wherwell closed their innings on 193 for 7.

A lite tea was taken...and the Wherwell attack tuned up. Nicel started the fun in his first over producing a vicious in swinging Yorker to remove the opener then 2 more for LBW decisions in his subsequent overs, not to be left out a Trucker slower ball gave Guilfoyle a simple catch. It looked as though Wherwell were going to repeat the previous weeks performance but a solid knock of 52 from Comptons H Pone and a few half chances not taken saw the home side keeping well up with the run rate however with drinks taken change often occurs and this was no different. Nathan Young was introduced and ripped through the tail taking 4 for 16 including 2 in 2 with identical balls, he teamed up with a salmon like Guilfoyle diving to his left at square leg to end the innings with the home side 60 runs short.
