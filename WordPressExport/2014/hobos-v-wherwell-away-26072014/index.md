KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled east towards to Basingstoke for what has become a familiar trip (having played away 3 years running to Hobos). After losing the Wherwell were asked to field on probably the hottest Saturday of the year, as the bowlers rotated in the heat Wherwell struggled with the conditions as a few errors crept in. They did however get a injection of energy at second drinks as they started chipping away at the wickets wit regular success. Pick of the bowlers was Nathan Young 9.3 overs 30 runs for 4 wickets as Hobos posted a challenging 202 on a crumbling pitch, special mention to Alex Gladwyn who managed to take 5 catches in the outfield.

Wherwell started the reply in great shape as Craig Beckingham opened his arms and regularly found the boundary, unfortunately he tried 1 shot to many and sparked a mini Wherwell collapse as Wherwell found themselves in trouble. Ali bowled superbly for his 4-24 managing to get variable bounce and turn. Wherwells lower order batted with real fight as they dug in, Matt Guilfoyle counter-attacked and managed to push Wherwell close with a form finding 41. Unfortunately despite some great running from the tail Wherwell finished 12 runs short as they finished 190 all out.
