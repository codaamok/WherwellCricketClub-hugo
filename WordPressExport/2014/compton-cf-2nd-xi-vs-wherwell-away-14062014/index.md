KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Compton looking to make it back to back wins in this fragmented season. Overnight rain had caught out the home side and the covers had not been used meaning there was a drying surface making the idea of bowling first highly inviting. Nathan Young called correct and had no hesitation inviting the home side to bat.

Stuart Taylor and Craig Beckingham took the new ball and immediately batting looked difficult with inconsistent bounce and pace troubling the batters, it was Taylor who made the breakthrough having the open adjudged caught behind with the score struggling to stay ahead of the overs, a brief flurry from the home side number 4 pushed the scoring rate to nearly 3 an over and the home side looked set for a reasonable score with wickets in hand but Wherwells change bowlers were all on song and the home side stalled and stuttered from 51 for 2 to 106 all out. Nathan Young with 3 for 32 was the most successful bowler and 2 wickets a piece for Matt Guilfoyle and Russel Ingrem plus a superb run out by the latter combination showed how tight Wherwell have become as a team backing up each other in the field and placing bodies on the line.

With a low target Craig Beckingham and Jeremy Wickham opened the batting, Beckingham looked in a hurry but went for a shot too many and was caught at point, Gladwyn too looked the be positive but perished in the same manor. This brought Taylor to the crease off the back of a league ton in his previous match. What had looked a difficult pitch matched with tidy bowling suddenly appeared to be a carpet with gentle throw downs. Taylor defended his first ball then hit his second for 6, this set a tone for an onslaught that took the game away from the home side, with the watchful Wickham supporting Taylor smashed the ball to all parts and raced towards 50. He fell for 48 to a catch on the boundary looking to hit the ball into next week, Wickham too perished going for an out of character slog sweep, but Charlie Ingrem following instructions to "knock it about and do it in singles" went 6 - 4 game over. Wherwell took the win with 6 wickets and 26 overs remaining.
