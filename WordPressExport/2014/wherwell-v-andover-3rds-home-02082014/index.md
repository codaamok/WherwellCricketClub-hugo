KJM sponsored Wherwell took on Andover 3rds trying to turn around a recent run of defeats. After winning the toss Wherwell decided to bat knowing the weather was going to play a part. After only 3 over the players rushed of the pitch due to a heavy downpour. Exactly 60 minutes and after some hard work the ground was deemed playable. Wherwell lost 3 quick wickets as the pitch was damp on top and Robin Richards 5-12 from 9 overs exposed the uncovered pitch. Ollie Cox (2-35) bowled well from the other as they tied Wherwell batsman up. Elton Adamo (68) decided that attack was the best form of defence as he went about building a innings as the pitch started to recover and became playable again. Charlie Ingrem (26) and Luke Trebert (19) enabled the tail to wag as Wherwell crawled to 187 all out.

After the rain calculated lunch Andover needed 125 from 25 overs. Wherwell knew they needed to field well and perform to the best to stand a chance. Matt Guilfoyle and Stuart Taylor both taking wickets and catches put Wherwell firmly in the driving seat taking wickets on a regular basis. Alex Aldridge 20 dug in and tried to help his team nudge towards to total, he was supported by Ollie Cox as they built a partnership but the bowling attack proved to much as Matt Guilfoyle bowled great lines and lengths claiming a career best 6-24 supported by Taylor 2-45 and Nathan Young 2-11.

Andover now face a tough battle to avoid relegation but with the spirt shown on Saturday they could and should be able to pull it off.
