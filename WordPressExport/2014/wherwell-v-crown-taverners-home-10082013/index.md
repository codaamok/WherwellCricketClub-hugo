KJM sponsored Wherwell hosted Crown Taverners in a mid table clash. Wherwell won the toss and elected to bowl on a flat batting strip knowing using the new ball would be key and so it proved. Stuart Taylor 3-32 and Christian Nicel 2-20 opened the bowling and bowled tight lines creating chances by keeping the run rate down. Both picked up wickets in first few overs as the pace proved too much. A full stretch leap from Young in the slips ensured Wherwell maintained real pressure as Wherwell knocked over the top order. Rob Hodgkison 89 not out and Jerry Comfort offered Crown taverners only real meaningful innings as they were restricted to a  well below par 156-7.

In reply Wherwell were very watchful as Ryan Larbey and John Comfort bowled great lines at a good pace ensuring Wherwell only scored 8 runs from first 9 overs. This didn't affect Wherwell though as they soon found the grove and started finding boundaries with ease. Elton Adamo hitting some big shots for 38 until he got bowled around the legs by Rob Hodgkison. Christian Nice'ls fine form with the bat continued as he hit a forceful 68 not out well supported by Gladwyn 24 not out to enable Wherwell to reach the target with 13 overs remaining.
