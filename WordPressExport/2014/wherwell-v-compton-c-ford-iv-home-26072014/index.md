Compton & C Ford travelled to Wherwell on one of warmest days of the year, to having one won the toss and elected to bowl first. Experienced skipper Mick Ling with up-and-coming youthful member Nick Baughen opened the batting, however young Baughen was quickly caught out. Wherwell not long after lost another wicket and were looking in trouble within the first ten overs, but new player Giles Elwes soon walked up to the crease and hit the highest score of the day, 65. This quickly regaining Wherwell's stability. As overs and wickets went on, the likes of Jordan Trebert and Simon Shickland hit solid scores to carry Wherwell up to a respectable total of 175 all out.

After Compton & C Ford's punishment in the mid-day heat, Wherwell continued to thrive with Robby Gladwyn for 10 overs, 36 runs and 4 wickets. Young Baughen redeemed himself by taking a much needed wicket early on, which later enabled Ling to take another two, followed by Cray finishing off with 3.1 overs, 1 run and 2 wickets.

This was Wherwell's 2nd XI first win of the year and it was achieved by tremendous team spirit recognised throughout the entire day by all players.
