KJM sponsored Wherwell lost the toss and were invited to bat first, with a strong side and on the back of 2 wins there was a positive feeling in the dressing room that unfortunately didn’t last long. Faced with steady bowlers looking for nothing more than line and length bowling the batsmen just surrendered. Only Mick Ling with 17 threatened to hang around but succumbed to a straight ball that he pulled to the fielder at square Leg with unerring accuracy. In the 22nd over Wherwell were 8 down with only 46 on the board, batting deep Paul Whyton and Harry Trebert dug in, both riding their luck more than once they got bat on ball and looked to hit the odd loose ball, most importantly they kept the visitors in the field. Whyton was eventually caught for 11 out of a partnership of 50 and when the last wicket fell partially blamed on a “wasp in my helmet” the score was a below par 99 and Trebert was 30 not out.

The bowling had to be tight but from the off there were too many loose balls as the opening bowlers tried a little too hard for wickets, the only success was a great diving catch by Oli Emslie off the bowling of Trebert and the former then produced a toe crusher for a plumb LBW but there was no further success as the visitors reached the total in half the overs with 8 wickets in hand.
