KJM sponsored Wherwells good start to the season came to a grinding halt against Dinton as the batsman went missing in the sun. Wherwell posted a well below par 110 all out from 33 overs.Â Knowing it would be very difficult to defend Wherwell had to attack from the off. A wicket in the 3rd over got Wherwells hopes up but that was to be it till Dinton had all but won the won game. The return of Nicel from the farm end helped Wherwell pick up a bowling point as he took 2 wickets but this wasn't enough as Dinton cruised to 112-3 after just 25 overs.
