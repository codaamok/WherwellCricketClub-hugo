Both teams went into the game knowing it was going to be a real close one. KJM sponsored Wherwell in true tradition lost the toss and were asked to bat. Craig Beckingham and Stuart Taylor opened the batting and faced a some good lines and lengths from Robin Richards and Robbie Taylor. A smart catch by Stewart Clackson seen the end of Craig Beckingham, Taylor got a lifeline when bowled from a no-ball, he would go one to punish the bowlers for this mistake. A couple more quick wickets seen the returning Marc Von Guionneau the crease and he continued where he left of last season hitting the ball very hard to all parts of the ground making a very quickfire 24 before chipping one up to midwicket. Taylor then passed 50 still looking in good shape as wickets fell around him. Going into the last 5 overs Taylor required only 10 runs but had only 2 wickets left. Unfortunately Taylor was run out for 95 with 2 overs remaining as Wherwell ended 179 all out.

In reply Andover knew scoring 180 wouldn't be easy but gave it great go. Taylor and Christian Nicel bowled well in tandem and no surprise it was Taylor who made the breakthrough as it turned out to be his day. He picked up 2 wickets on in his first spell, Nathan Youngs spin reduced the rate and picked up 2 wickets for 24 runs from his 8 overs, John Foster took a few overs to get rid of the cobwebs but started to get into the swing of things hitting some good lines but A strong innings from Stewart Clackson looked promising for the home side but a full stretch stunning catch from Rory Stewart Richardson was the end of him. A few big hits made the game close towards the end as Andover only required 5 a over with 5 overs left. Stuart Taylor returned to did a brilliant job cleaning up the tail. Taylor 4-41 from 9 overs. Andover 162 all out from 42 overs.
