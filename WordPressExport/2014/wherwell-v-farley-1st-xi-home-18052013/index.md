Kjm sponosred wherwell got there season off to a flyer by producing a  great team display. Losing the toss Wherwell were ask to bat on a very green strip. Staurt  "Trucker"Taylor (11) and new opening partner Ed John (10)set the tone as the dug deep and kept the new ball out for 10 overs. Ed John miss-timed a ball and that popped up to mid on. This brought a mini collapse as Taylor and Beckingham soon followed.  David Langford (37) and Alex Galdwyn (62) played sensibly and pick the bad balls both looked in seriously good touch. Unfortunately both got out, but the tailed wagged a bit to make sure Wherwell got a good total of 191-9.

After a huge tea reminiscent of an end of summer feast Wherwell never gave Farley a chance as the  whole team got fired up. Lead by skipper Taylor (7-3-9-3) and Christian Nicel (9 - 3 - 18 -5) displayed great control and aggression as they ripped the top order, middlle the order and tail apart. Supported by customary display of great fielding notably Nathan Young and Christian Nicel clinging on to flyers in the slips, Farley were 25-9 before a last wicket pair seen them to 58 all out.
