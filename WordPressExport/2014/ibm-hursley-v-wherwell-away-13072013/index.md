KJM sponsored Wherwell 2nd XI won the toss and chose to field on a hot summer's afternoon. Emslie and Trebert again opened the bowling for Wherwell. Emslie picked up two wickets and could of had a third but a difficult catch was dropped by Ling. Trebert was also picking up wickets at the other end and he ended up with figures of 3-30 of his 8 overs. Cook picked up a couple of wicket and Ed John cleaned up the tail. IBM ending up 142 all out.

After tea Wherwell knew that the total was very gettable but after losing the early wicket of Trebert, Micki Ling knew he was going to have to anchor the innings,Ed John went in and hit his first ball for four then tried to play the same shot again and got caught by the fielder. Harry Trebert and Mick Ling settled the nerves of the team and began to build a partnership, knocking of the runs one by one until Trebert was bowled for 16. In came Emslie to the crease and he was playing some good shots down the ground and started hitting boundaries on regular occasions, Emslie then wanted a quick single due to a wicket keeping error saw Mick ran out for 38 bringing Charles Ingrem to the crease who was off to a nervy start playing and missing, but then he soon found his timing and started hitting the ball clearing to the boundary. Losing Emslie for 27 only brought Adam Cook in at 7. Ingrem then hit a huge six off a no ball to take Wherwell to within 6 of victory and they were knocked off with ease and Wherwell won by 4 wickets.
