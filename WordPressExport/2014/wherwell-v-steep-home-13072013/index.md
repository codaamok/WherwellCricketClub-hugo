KJM sponsored Wherwell entertained unbeaten and top of the league Steep. Losing the toos Wherwell were put into field and it was always going to be a batsmen's day. The innings was built on Knight 79 and Noble 89 who forming a huge partnership.They both excellently rotated the strike in the hot summers afternoon wearing down the Wherwell bowlers. When Noble ran out of steam and skied one to the keeper. A few other contributions from others saw Steep to a very good score 231.

This was felt to be a stiff target for Wherwell to chase down, but the Steep opening pair were in a charitable mood and failed to find their normal tight lines. The second wicket pair of Taylor 34 and Beckingham exceeded 50 and worried looks were on the faces of the Steep fielders. However, Steep had strength in depth and the change bowlers soon broke the stand. It remained tough going as Wherwell showed they had a deep batting line up. The scoring rate was accelerating worryingly Adamo and Guilfoyle showed some enterprising shots to keep Wherwell in the hunt, but in the end it wasn't enough and although the winning margin of 25 runs suggests a relatively easy victory but it was not so, Steep managed to scrape home and maintain their unbeaten run and stay top of the league.
