KJM sponsored Wherwell 2nd XI travelled to the picturesque ground of Farley on a blazing hot day.

With many players unavailable or called into the 1st XI it was very much a makeshift team that won the toss and elected to field much to the home teams surprise.

Robbie Skeates (10-19-2) opened the bowling down the hill and it was soon apparent that the wicket offered much for the new ball as it flew off the many dents left from previous use in the damp weather. Skeates made the breakthrough clean bowling both openers and with Harry Trebert (9-45-3)on as first change also getting movement wickets came regularly. Good catches were taken by Robbie Weeks and Peter Puplitt who both also bowled well and were rewarded with wickets but a stubborn partnership for the 7th wicket saw the home side narrowly pass the 200 closing at 204 for 8.

Wherwell got off to a solid start with both Mick Ling (25) and Skeates (18) playing watchfully and taking the runs on offer, Trebert, batting at 3, showed confidence and ability to score 22. Contributions kept coming and with Paul Whyton (33)coming in at 6 Wherwell were on target to chase the score however the lower order though dogged were not able to find the runs and in spite of good bowling held out to close the innings on 156 for 6.Although a defeat there were many positives with bowling, batting and fielding that make for a good season ahead.
