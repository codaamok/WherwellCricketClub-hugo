KJM sponsored Wherwell Second Xl cruised to a club record win against Alderholt Second X1.

Despite the summer holidays reducing Wherwell to 9 players, the club amassed 307 for 5 wickets during their allotted 42 overs - a club record. Star of the show was undoubtedly Charlie Ingrem. Smashing the ball to all parts of Alderholt’s lovely ground he raced past fifty before a muscle injury forced him to retire. Steve Bonser also notched a fifty before re-arranging his wicket by means of falling over it. Ice packs had worked magic enabling Charlie returned to complete his hundred, ably supported by debutant skipper (and new to the village) Giles Elwes - 47 not out - and Russell Ingrem who despatched the last two balls for a six and a four - finishing on 20 not out. Fielding a full eleven players, Alderholt were overwhelmed by the task facing them.

Robbie Gladwyn reduced run scoring to a trickle and finished with figures of 8 runs off 6 overs for 4 wickets. At the other end Mike Hayden was proving equally as difficult to get away and as desperation set in some imprudent shots from Alderholt batters allowed Russell Ingrem, fielding up very close, to make four excellent catches. In less than 20 overs Alderholt had succumbed with just 41 runs on the board.

A win by 266 is a record win for Wherwell Cricket Club and it has provided a real highlight towards the end of the season.
