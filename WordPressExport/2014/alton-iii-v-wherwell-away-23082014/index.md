Wherwell 1st X1's skipper, Craig Beckingham, won the toss and decided to bowl first on a green pitch with overcast conditions.

The first innings ticked along nicely for Wherwell with tremendous pressure on Alton where they were just 25 runs off 10 overs. However, with such consistency from both sides, Oliver Emslie went for 21 off 7 overs for 0 and Craig Beckingham at 25 off 7 overs for 2 wickets. Their number two batsman retained consistent temperament and patience to score a well earned 46 where wickets were eventually falling around him. Whilst Wherwell's fielding efforts were not at their peak, the likes of Nathan Young and Alex Gladwyn picked up a further 7 wickets between them. Young with 46 off 10 overs for 3 wickets and Gladwyn with 28 off 6 overs for 3 wickets. Alton finished on 196 for 7.

Wherwell's openers rapidly got out after just six overs, putting Wherwell in a far too familiar situation. However, Stuart Taylor quickly retained Wherwell's pride and put them on the front foot again with his much needed 50. The partnership by Charlie Ingrem (23) and Paul Whyton (17) gave Wherwell high hopes for a glimse at finishing the season off with a win. Wherwell fell short of 46 runs, finishing on 146 all out. Alton's win means they were promoted.
