KJM sponsored Wherwell always knew this trip would be a tough one and so it proved under the blazing sun they were asked to bat first on what looked a good track. Taylor and John started well but both fell as the pitch showed some variable pace and bounce. Once again indiscipline showed as the middle order got them selves out with a combination of poor shot choice and bad luck. At one point Wherwell were struggling at 56 for 8 but some clean hitting from Charlie Ingrem and Christian Nicel go the total to 132 which was at least something to bowl at.

The bowlers came out after tea and ripped through the Petersfield top order, Taylor taking 1 for 2 from his initial 6 over spell and Nicel bowling unchanged in the heat for 10 overs 3 for 23 injected panic into the home side. This was summed up when a hit over the top was chased down by Dave Langford who was the only player awake to the fact the ball had plugged in the soft outfield and whilst the batsmen admired his shot Langford got the ball back in quickly and a relay to the keeper found the batsman well short and highly embarrassed. At this point Peterfield were 16 for 5 but the ball went soft and what movement there was faded as the 6th wicket pair dug in, rode their luck and built a partnership that took them to the brink of victory, only being parted with 4 required thanks to a rare Dave Langford catch. This made little difference to the result as the home team claimed a 4 wicket win with 4 overs to spare.
