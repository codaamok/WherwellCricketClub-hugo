A depleted 2nds team took on Centurions. With only a few bowlers available the task was always going to be tough. Brendan Tasker 43-2, Rob Weeks 47-2 and Charles Ingram 3runs -4 wickets were the pick of the bowlers as they bowled them out for 163. In reply Wherwell started well with Mick Ling (28) and Nigel Horne 68 not out, (first ever league 50) providing a foundation for which Wherwell hoped to kick on but unfortunately it wasn't to be as they fell 8runs short of the target. 155-3.
