KJM Sponsored Wherwell made the trip to Hobos just outside of Basingstoke, in an unlikely turn of events captain Stuart Taylor won the toss and for a change Wherwell chose to bowl first on a very average looking strip. This decision soon proved to be vindicated with the Wherwell bowlers taking regular wickets. The visiting side bowled Hobos out inside 21 overs for just 57. Nathan Young 3 for 4, Christian Nicel 3 for 12, Matt Guilfoyle 3 for 14 andÂ Stuart Taylor 1-15 picking up all the wickets.

After an earlier than anticipated tea Wherwell made a steady start to chasing the runs down, despite losing Craig Beckingham early. Stuart Taylor and Christian Nicel decided they would take the attack on, knocking the ball to all parts of the ground and chasing down the runs in just 10 overs. A comfortable nine complete and an early finish the team then decided to head back to Wherwell to support the 2nd XI on.
