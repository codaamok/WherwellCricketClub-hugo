Wherwell suffered a 10 wicket home defeat at the hands of a strong Sparsholt side. Having lost the toss the home side were skittled for 115 with only Charlie Ingrem and Cray Sams showing resistance. The bowlers too were up against it and found the visitors opening pair impregnable as they cruised to the target of 116 with several overs to spare
