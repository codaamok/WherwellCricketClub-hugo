KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled the short distance over to Whitchurch in a must win game to keep survival hopes alive. Both teams hampered with injuries and holidays did well to field to 11 players. Wherwell lost the toss and were asked to bat, Wherwell got lucky in the first over when Taylor was dropped from his first ball, something Whitchurch would go on to regret. Leamon fell early at the other end to a well taken catch. Both opening bowlers bowled well without the rewards disserved. S Ralph and K Ralph pinned Wherwell back as they looked to build a partnership Taylor got going for the first time this season as him and Taylor set about increasing the run rate. Jakeman soon fell for 16 this brought the classy Stewart-Richardson into the crease an set about bowling hitting a quick fire 37 including one over of 22. This set Wherwell up for a late push, Taylor finally fell for 57 LBW to his old team mate Marriot. Nathan Young 45 and Ed John 33 had some fun in the last 10 overs hitting a 50+ partnership to frustrate Whitchuch as Wherwell ended 229 all out. Pick of the bowlers was Dodd 4-44.

Whitchurch always knew that chasing 229 second was going to be hard and so it proved as Christian Nicel  and Taylor removed the 2 openers, Good sensible batting from the middle order Greeham 49 and Western 37 seen Whitchurch claw there way back into the game but tight bowling soon stopped that as Guilfoyle and Young stopped any chance they had. Damo Hack come in for a bash at the end and made sure Whitchurch picked up a extra batting point as he took them to 176-7.
