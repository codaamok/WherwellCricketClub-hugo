Sparsholt won the toss and elected to bat. Missing many of the regular players, Wherwell's makeshift attack restricted Sparsholt to 166-5 in 45 overs on a belter of a wicket. Stuart Taylor and Alex Gladwyn took 2 wickets each and Nathan Young took the other. The highlight of the innings was 61 runs scored by A Gough. Wherwell fielding deserve a special mention, for their hard work in the sweltering heat. Chairman Young stated "I died in the field and took 4 balls to reply to a question... as I couldn't get my breath back."

With the sun beating down, Wherwell showing no love chased the target down in 27 overs. Jordan Trebert was sent back early in the 3rd over for 5 runs . Coming in at 3, Stuart Taylor shared a 109 run partnership for the second wicket. Alex Gladwyn and Stuart Taylor finished off the chase. S Taylor played a blinder of an innings and scored his second hundred of the season, he finished on 107 not out. Taylor also owes a drink or two to an unnamed Sparsholt player, who dropped him on 99.
