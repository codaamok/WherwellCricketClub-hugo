Wherwell made the journey to Promotion chasing Bishops Waltham on a gloriously sunny summers day knowing that the chance of promotion had likely slipped by for another year but still with plenty of positives to play for.

Skipper for the day, Alex Gladwyn, won the toss and elected to bowl first under the clear skies on what looked to be a cracking strip much to the bemusement of his team. However once the opening bowlers got loose it proved an inspired decision both Emslie and Taylor bowled with great control and were backed up in the field with Charlie Ingrem in particular excelling at cover. Early wickets and tight lines kept the home, previously free scoring, batters in check and set the tone for the day as each bowler in turn kept the pressure on and produced wickets at the right times. A fine fielding team performance highlighted by a great run out with Ingrem and Whyton combining to remove a batter clearly exposed to the Ben Stokes school of running your bat in! on what was seen a 250+ pitch the home side limped to 162 for 9 from their 45.

Wherwell came out confident following tea and Robbie Skeates set about the run chase, supported by Craig Beckingham, as if he was on a promise... the pair put on 100 before Beckingham fell to a faint glove behind for 22 and Skeates, tiring under the now humid conditions was trapped LBW for 79 but despite a couple of quick wickets and a "Golden Duck" for the skipper Young and Guilfoyle were composed enough to see the visitors record a deserved 5 wicket win with almost a quarter of the overs left.

The team look forward now to a final home match against already relegated Winterslow knowing once again that with a bit of consistency promotion is a 2016 possibility.
