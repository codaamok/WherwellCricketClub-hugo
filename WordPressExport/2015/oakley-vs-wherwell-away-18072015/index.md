KJM sponsored Wherwell travelled to Oakley for the first time in a few years. After winning the toss Skipper Nathan Young thought it would be a good idea to bowl on a slightly green track. The pitch however offered very little to the bowlers. Skipper Young and Oliver Emslie opened the bowling with no success, a few bowling changes followed though as Wherwell searched for a breakthrough. Oakley openers Dique 92 and Summer 54 put on a magnificent 133 run partnership as they made Wherwell work very hard. It wasn't till the 27 over when John Foster was introduced into the attack that they finally got the deserved breakthrough. Foster and Taylor bowled well in tandem. Foster bowled 9 overs for 41 runs - 3 wickets. Stuart Taylor was the pick of the bowlers taking 4 wickets for 40 runs. Oakley finished 202-7.

In reply Wherwell started in true aggressive fashion as Craig Beckingham 33 and Robbie Skeates 41 built a great platform to start. The middle order however for once failed as Wherwell found themselves in serious trouble as Potter ran through the middle order for a very impressive 6 wickets for 55 runs. Nathan Young and Oliver Emslie found themselves at the crease with Wherwell 130-8 from just 25 overs. Knowing it would be a huge task they both set about chipping away at the runs slowly. Young the more aggressive of the 2 managed to get a few boundaries away as his confidence grew. Emslie 14 not out offering the ore controlled approach was a great partner for Young 53 not out as the got themselves over the line with just 9 balls to spare. The partnership was worth 74 and Wherwell highest 9th wicket partnership in league cricket for numerous years.

Wherwell still remain within a chance of promotion but must win 5 of the last 6 games.
